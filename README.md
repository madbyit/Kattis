# General
For Linux, you can write your C# program in various text editors like VS Code,Vim (or vi), Sublime, Atom, etc. 
To compile and run our C# program in Linux, we will use Mono which is an open-source implementation of the .NET framework.

# Install
sudo apt install mono-complete

# Compile -> Run
Compile the program: 
$ mcs filename.cs
That gives us an filename.exe file

Run .exe with command: 
$ mono filename.exe
